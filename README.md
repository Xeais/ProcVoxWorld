- [SQLite](https://sqlite.org)-database to store map and player information.
- Depth of field (smooth/non-smooth)

- Right mouse button = Place block.
- Mouse scroll wheel = Change build block.
- Esc = Release the cursor.

## Supported Platforms
The release versions run with ...
- Windows 10/11: :thumbsup: plus ...
- POSIX-compliant operating systems:
  - most Linux distributions: :open_hands: and ...
  - macOS: :open_hands:.

:thumbsup: = tested, okay | :open_hands: =	not tested, but most likely

**Explanatory notes:**
- *Rule*: If the dependency offers one or more releases, go for the latest one unless it is several years behind the main branch.
- This file and the directory structure for the dependencies (based on the example of vcpkg) were created on *January 21, 2022*.

## Requirements
- Windows 10 (Version 21H1) â€“ only tested with that version
- Requires an up-to-date Windows 10 SDK; version 10.0.20348.0 does the job. Windows 11 with its SDK (from version 10.0.22000) should also be functional as development platform.
- If you set up your own development environment, you should also be able to work with ProcVoxWorld under Linux or macOS.
---
- All dependencies are already included.
- No include pathes / other pathes have to be adjusted because macros are used in the [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) [solution (.sln) file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/internals/solution-dot-sln-file?view=vs-2019). While it's certainly possible to get it working with another IDE (see: third spot right above), with Visual Studio 2019 and up ([Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) is completely sufficient) it will be the easiest, as the project was obviously created with it.
